# Exercise 2

Design a database which will store the relevant information needed to operate a cinema. What kind of information do we need to store? What are the different concepts a cinema needs to interact with? How is that information connected? What are the relationships between the different datasets? What business needs and what kind of processes does the database have to satisfy? Think about the process you go through when you go to a cinema or book a ticket online:

* you need to see a list of movies and the times they run,
* you need to see if there are any available seats,
* you need to be able to make a reservation for one or more seats,
* you need to be able to buy a ticket.

The final result of exersice should contain screenshot of your ERD for database and SQL script that let's for other developer to create database  with all tables from scratch with some example data inserted.

Make sure that your designed database is suitable to:

* List all movies.
* List all movies running on e.g. 2020-01-01.
* List all movies that are not yet scheduled to run in the cinema.
* List all movies reserved by e.g. John Johnson.
* List all the seat rows and numbers reserved by e.g. John Johnson.
* List all tickets sold for e.g Joker.
* List the number of adult and children tickets sold for e.g. Joker.
* List the average number of tickets sold for each movie.
* List the highest number of tickets sold for a movie.
* List the unreserved seats for e.g. Joker.
