# Entity relationship model

An **entityâ€“relationship model** (or **ER model**) describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge. A basic ER model is composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships that can exist between [entities](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/entity) (instances of those entity types).

**ER Diagram** stands for Entity Relationship Diagram, also known as ERD is a diagram that displays the relationship of entity sets stored in a database.
